# Gym System
The Gym Management System is an online platform designed to manage member and employee interactions within a gym. The system allows users to log in as either employees or members, each with specific capabilities according to their roles. The project’s functionality is modeled based on a detailed UML diagram, outlining the core classes, controllers, and interactions.
